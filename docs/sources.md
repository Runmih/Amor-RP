Reviewed 2026-10-06. Links establish platform capabilities or requirements, not a
successful Amor RP integration. Prices, APIs and policies must be rechecked at the
relevant milestone. Use primary documentation/source; do not rely on remembered
provider paths or snippets from unrelated plugins.

External approval is not implied by technical feasibility. Context-menu and chat
behavior need real game testing. Official plugin distribution needs its own human
submission/review process. No messages to external maintainers were sent.
